    <b><h3>About Me</h3></b>
    <p>
        This is my about me page. I have nothing to say. I am boring and uninteresting, except when I am not. If you read this, I'd be amazed. Thank you for reading. Goodbye.

        I also like very big dogs. I have two of them in my backyard. Unlike what many people believe, they do not eat a ton; however, it is like having two giant pieces of furniture. All these animals do is sleep and take up floor space. I have another paragraph to write. I don't have anything else to say.
        <br><br><br>

        Why am I still doing this?!?
